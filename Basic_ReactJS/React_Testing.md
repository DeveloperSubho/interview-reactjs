146. ### What is Shallow Renderer in React testing?

     _Shallow rendering_ is useful for writing unit test cases in React. It lets you render a component _one level deep_ and assert facts about what its render method returns, without worrying about the behavior of child components, which are not instantiated or rendered.

     For example, if you have the following component:

     ```javascript
     function MyComponent() {
       return (
         <div>
           <span className={"heading"}>{"Title"}</span>
           <span className={"description"}>{"Description"}</span>
         </div>
       );
     }
     ```

     Then you can assert as follows:

     ```jsx harmony
     import ShallowRenderer from "react-test-renderer/shallow";

     // in your test
     const renderer = new ShallowRenderer();
     renderer.render(<MyComponent />);

     const result = renderer.getRenderOutput();

     expect(result.type).toBe("div");
     expect(result.props.children).toEqual([
       <span className={"heading"}>{"Title"}</span>,
       <span className={"description"}>{"Description"}</span>,
     ]);
     ```

147. ### What is `TestRenderer` package in React?

     This package provides a renderer that can be used to render components to pure JavaScript objects, without depending on the DOM or a native mobile environment. This package makes it easy to grab a snapshot of the platform view hierarchy (similar to a DOM tree) rendered by a ReactDOM or React Native without using a browser or `jsdom`.

     ```jsx harmony
     import TestRenderer from "react-test-renderer";

     const Link = ({ page, children }) => <a href={page}>{children}</a>;

     const testRenderer = TestRenderer.create(
       <Link page={"https://www.facebook.com/"}>{"Facebook"}</Link>
     );

     console.log(testRenderer.toJSON());
     // {
     //   type: 'a',
     //   props: { href: 'https://www.facebook.com/' },
     //   children: [ 'Facebook' ]
     // }
     ```

148. ### What is the purpose of ReactTestUtils package?

     _ReactTestUtils_ are provided in the `with-addons` package and allow you to perform actions against a simulated DOM for the purpose of unit testing.

149. ### What is Jest?

     _Jest_ is a JavaScript unit testing framework created by Facebook based on Jasmine and provides automated mock creation and a `jsdom` environment. It's often used for testing components.

150. ### What are the advantages of Jest over Jasmine?

     There are couple of advantages compared to Jasmine:

     - Automatically finds tests to execute in your source code.
     - Automatically mocks dependencies when running your tests.
     - Allows you to test asynchronous code synchronously.
     - Runs your tests with a fake DOM implementation (via `jsdom`) so that your tests can be run on the command line.
     - Runs tests in parallel processes so that they finish sooner.

151. ### Give a simple example of Jest test case

     Let's write a test for a function that adds two numbers in `sum.js` file:

     ```javascript
     const sum = (a, b) => a + b;

     export default sum;
     ```

     Create a file named `sum.test.js` which contains actual test:

     ```javascript
     import sum from "./sum";

     test("adds 1 + 2 to equal 3", () => {
       expect(sum(1, 2)).toBe(3);
     });
     ```

     And then add the following section to your `package.json`:

     ```json
     {
       "scripts": {
         "test": "jest"
       }
     }
     ```

     Finally, run `yarn test` or `npm test` and Jest will print a result:

     ```console
     $ yarn test
     PASS ./sum.test.js
     ✓ adds 1 + 2 to equal 3 (2ms)
     ```
